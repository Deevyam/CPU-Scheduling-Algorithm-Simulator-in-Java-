<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>In this project, I've implemented various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling (Non-preemptive), and Round Robin. These algorithms are crucial for process management in operating systems, ensuring efficient CPU utilization and process handling. Each algorithm is written in Java, providing a clear and structured approach to CPU scheduling. Feel free to explore the code, and if you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please let me know!</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

  <summary>Click to view implemented algorithms</summary>
  
  <ul>
    <li>First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
      <ul>
        <li>Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Shortest Job First (SJF)
      <ul>
        <li>Processes with the shortest burst time are executed first.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Priority Scheduling (Non-preemptive)
      <ul>
        <li>Processes are executed based on their priority. If two processes have the same priority, they are executed based on arrival time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Round Robin
      <ul>
        <li>Each process is assigned a fixed time in cyclic order, ensuring that all processes get a fair share of CPU time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.</li>
  <li>An IDE or text editor to run and modify the code (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.).</li>
</ul>
