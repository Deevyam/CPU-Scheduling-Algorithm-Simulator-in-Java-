<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>In this project, I have developed and implemented several CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling (Non-preemptive), and Round Robin. These algorithms play a vital role in process management within operating systems, aiming to optimize CPU utilization and ensure effective process handling. Each algorithm is meticulously coded in Java, offering a clear, structured, and efficient approach to CPU scheduling. I encourage you to explore the code, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
      <ul>
        <li>Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Shortest Job First (SJF)
      <ul>
        <li>Processes with the shortest burst time are executed first.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Priority Scheduling (Non-preemptive)
      <ul>
        <li>Processes are executed based on their priority. If two processes have the same priority, they are executed based on arrival time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Round Robin
      <ul>
        <li>Each process is assigned a fixed time in cyclic order, ensuring that all processes get a fair share of CPU time.</li>
      </ul>
